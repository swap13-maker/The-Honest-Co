                    Blockchain technology, best known for its role in
                    cryptocurrency transactions, offers a decentralized and
                    immutable ledger system that records transactions across
                    multiple nodes. In the context of staffing and recruitment,
                    blockchain provides a secure and transparent platform for
                    verifying the authenticity of candidate credentials,
                    tracking the history of job placements, and ensuring
                    compliance with regulatory requirements. Let's delve into
                    the key features and benefits of blockchain technology in
