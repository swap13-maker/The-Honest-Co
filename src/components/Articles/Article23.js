                    Traditional recruitment processes can be stressful and

                    Traditional face-to-face interviews can be costly and
                    time-consuming, especially for organizations with
                    distributed teams or global recruitment needs. Video
                    interviewing platforms eliminate the need for travel and
                    accommodation expenses and reduce the time spent
                    coordinating interviews. By streamlining the interview
                    process, organizations can save valuable resources and focus
                    on more strategic recruitment activities.
